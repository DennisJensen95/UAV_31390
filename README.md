This Github repository contains solutions to exercise part 1-5 and solutions to the simulation exercises, but does not contain solutions to theoretical exercises, which are shown in the PDF.\
\
The folder "lib" contains helper functions for rotation, both using quaternions and Euler angles.\
The folder "maze" contains our changes to the maze files in order to make the Gazebo/Simulink/Matlab simulation run smooth.\
Lastly, the three folders *_interface contains the solutions for making quadrotor controllers.
